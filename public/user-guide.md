- Optional: Trading 212 API credentials (if you want account sync)

---

## 3) First-Time Setup (One-Time)

1. Double-click `install.bat`
2. If Node.js is missing/unsupported, install Node.js 20 or 22 LTS and run `install.bat` again
3. Wait while installer sets up dependencies and database
4. Optional: choose whether to set up nightly Telegram task
5. When complete, use desktop shortcut or `start.bat`

## 5) Main Pages and What To Do There

## Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
Use this as your control center.

Check these first:
- Health traffic light (green/yellow/red)
- Market regime (bullish/sideways/bearish)
- Heartbeat freshness (nightly job health — green = SUCCESS, amber = PARTIAL, red = STALE/FAILED)
- Data source freshness (Live / Cache / Stale Cache indicator)
- Module panel statuses
- Fear & Greed and dual benchmark context

If a red health banner appears, fix that issue before placing trades.

## Portfolio Positions (`/portfolio/positions`)
Use this to manage open positions.

You can:
- sync positions from Trading 212
- view entry/current/stop, R-multiple, risk, and P&L

- close positions with exit-price preview

## Portfolio Distribution (`/portfolio/distribution`)
Use this to monitor concentration.

You can see:
- sleeve allocation
- cluster concentration

- win rate, average R, and stop-hit statistics
- filter by sleeve, regime, or action type
- requires nightly snapshot history to populate

## Signal Audit (`/signal-audit`)
Use this to check which signals are adding unique value.

Shows:
- mutual information heatmap (which signal pairs overlap)
- conditional MI bar chart (unique contribution per signal)
- recommendations: KEEP / INVESTIGATE / REDUNDANT per signal
- click "Run Analysis" to compute — not automatic

## Causal Audit (`/causal-audit`)

Shows:
- invariance scores per signal (causal vs regime-dependent)
- beta coefficients per regime environment
- recommendations for signals that may be spurious

## 6) Weekly Workflow (Recommended)

## Sunday — THINK
- review dashboard health/regime
- run full scan
- review READY candidates
- draft trade plan

## Monday — OBSERVE
- do not trade
- watch market behavior and gaps

## Tuesday — ACT
- confirm plan checklist is green/yellow
- verify candidates are still valid
- size positions and execute
- sync positions after execution

## Wednesday to Friday — MANAGE
- check dashboard health daily
- review stops and update when ladder thresholds are hit
- monitor risk budget and concentration

---

## 7) Core System Rules You Should Know

The platform enforces hard safety constraints, including:

- stops never move down
- no entries on Monday
- anti-chasing blocks excessive gap entries (tightened by historical slippage data)
- position sizing is risk-capped and rounded down
- total risk and concentration caps are enforced
- stale heartbeat/data triggers warnings or failures
- Yahoo Finance calls retry automatically on transient errors (3 attempts with backoff)
- on Tuesdays (execution day), price data is force-refreshed to bypass cache
- a watchdog script alerts via Telegram if the nightly pipeline fails to run

Treat these rules as safeguards, not optional suggestions.

---

## 8) Trading 212 Connection and Sync

If you connect Trading 212:

1. Open Settings and save credentials
2. Go to Positions page and run sync
3. Verify portfolio values and open positions after sync

If you disconnect later, stored credentials are removed; synced historical data remains.

---

## 9) Signal Messages (Telegram) Setup

Use this if you want nightly signal/summary messages in Telegram.

1. In Telegram, open **@BotFather** and create a bot (`/newbot`).
2. Copy the **bot token** from BotFather.
3. Send at least one message to your new bot.
4. Get your **chat ID** by opening this URL in a browser (replace `<TOKEN>`):
	- `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates`
	- Look for `"chat"` then the numeric `"id"` value.
5. Open HybridTurtle → **Settings** → **Telegram Notifications**.
6. Paste **Bot Token** and **Chat ID**, then click **Send Test Message**.
7. Add the same values to your `.env` file:
	- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="..."`
	- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="..."`
8. Restart the dashboard (`start.bat`) so environment variables are reloaded.

---

## 10) Nightly Automation (Optional)

If enabled in installer:
- runs on weeknights (scheduled task)
- executes health checks and stop-related automation
- can send Telegram summary (if token/chat ID are configured)

If PC is off at schedule time, task may run late when machine resumes (depending on task scheduler behavior).

---

## 11) Troubleshooting

## Installer says unsupported Node version
- install Node.js 20 or 22 LTS
- re-run `install.bat`

## `npm install` fails
- close other terminals/apps using project files
- temporarily disable antivirus
- run installer as Administrator
- reboot and retry

## Port 3000 is busy
- close old dashboard windows/terminals
- re-run `start.bat` (it attempts to clear stale process)

## Dashboard opens but no data
- run full scan from Scan page
- verify internet connection
- verify heartbeat and health status

## Trading 212 sync fails
- re-check credentials in Settings
- confirm API access is active
- retry sync from positions page

---

## 12) Update Procedure (When You Receive New Code)

1. Close running dashboard
2. Run `update.bat`
3. Run `start.bat`
4. Check dashboard health and heartbeat after launch

---

## 13) Quick Non-Technical Checklist

- Use `install.bat` once
- Use `start.bat` daily
- Keep terminal open while dashboard is running
- Check health + regime before trading
- Use Scan for candidates, Plan for timing, Risk for limits
- Move stops only upward (the app enforces this)
- Sync positions after trading activity
- Review nightly summaries/alerts regularly
