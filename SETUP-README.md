## Troubleshooting

### "Node.js not found"
Download and install from https://nodejs.org (choose the LTS version).
After installing, close and re-open the terminal, then try again.

### "npm install failed"
- Try running `install.bat` as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)
- Temporarily disable antivirus software
- Make sure you have internet access

### "Prisma engines do not seem to be compatible" / "not a valid Win32 application"
This means the Prisma database engine doesn't match your Node.js architecture. Usually caused by having 32-bit Node.js on a 64-bit machine.
1. Check your architecture: open a terminal and run `node -e "console.log(process.arch)"`
2. If it says `ia32` instead of `x64` — uninstall Node.js, then download and install the **64-bit (x64)** version from https://nodejs.org
3. Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `install.bat` again

If the architecture is already `x64`, the binary may be corrupted (e.g. antivirus quarantine). Delete `node_modules\.prisma`, then run `npx prisma generate`.

### "Port 3000 already in use"
The `start.bat` script handles this automatically. If it persists:
1. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
2. Find any "Node.js" processes
3. End them
4. Try `start.bat` again

### Dashboard shows no data
1. Go to the **Scan** page
2. Click **Run Full Scan** — this fetches live data from Yahoo Finance
3. The first scan may take 2-3 minutes for all 268 tickers

### Need to reset the database
Delete the file `prisma/dev.db` and run `install.bat` again.

### Trading 212 connection fails immediately / auth error
Trading 212 uses Basic Auth with base64 encoding, not a bearer token. Verify your API key and secret are correct and that you are using the right environment (Demo vs Live).
